Usage: cknker.exe [filename] [-x arg [-x arg]...[-yyy]..] [ = text ] ]

  -x is an option requiring an argument, -y an option with no argument.
  If the first command-line argument is the name of a file, interactive-
  mode commands are executed from the file.  The '=' argument tells Kermit
  not to parse the remainder of the command line, but to make the words
  following '=' available as \%1, \%2, ... \%9.  The command file (if any)
  is executed before the command-line options.

If no action command is included, or -S is, then after the command line is
executed, Kermit issues its prompt and waits for you to type commands.
