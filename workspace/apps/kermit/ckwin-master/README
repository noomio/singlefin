This is Kermit for Windows (formerly known as Kermit 95). For more information 
on Kermit, visit the Kermit Project website: http://www.kermitproject.org.

Currently the following features are disabled due to their use of obsolete
or proprietary libraries:
  - SSH
  - Kerberos
  - SRP
  - OpenSSL
  - X, Y and Z Modem
  - CTERM (DEC Pathworks)
  - LAT (DEC Pathworks or SuperLAT)

To build Kermit for Windows you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or higher.
Make edit /setenv.bat to point to your source directory. Then run through the 
following:
 1. Open up a console window
 2. Setup the Visual C++ environment. You'll want to run vcvars32.bat. This
    will be where ever you installed your compiler. For example:
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat
 3. CD into your source directory and run the following:
      setenv.bat
      cd kermit/k95
      mknt.bat
      mkg.bat
This should leave you with a bunch of binaries in your current directory, the
most interesting being:
  cknker.exe   - Console version of C-Kermit for Windows
  k95g.exe     - Graphical version of C-Kermit for Windows

Future stuff to do:
  * Remove need for /noBool switch and #defines in kui code.
  * Restore use of fsetpos in ckofio.c (see function zfseek(CK_OFF_T) around
    line 5418)
  * Turn long long support back on (remove -DNOLONGLONG in makefile)
  * Re-enable/rewrite features that were disabled to get it building such as:
    - SSH
    - Kerberos
    - zlib
    - OpenSSL
    - SRP
    - Z/Y/Z Modem
    - LAT
    This will require upgrading to current versions of the libraries or writing
    replacements.
